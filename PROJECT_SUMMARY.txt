PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

PROBLEM:

APPROACH:
Multinomial logistic regression with sophisticated feature engineering

KEY INNOVATION:
Recency-weighted team form features that emphasize recent performance over
historical data

TARGET PERFORMANCE:

METHODOLOGY HIGHLIGHTS
================================================================================

FEATURE ENGINEERING:
• Team form (recent wins, goals, points) with exponential recency weighting
• Differential features (home strength - away strength)
• Head-to-head statistics
• Attack vs defense matchups
• Team equality features (for draw prediction)

MODEL:
• Multinomial logistic regression (sklearn)
• L2 regularization (Ridge) to prevent overfitting
• Hyperparameter tuning with 5-fold time-series cross-validation
• StandardScaler for feature normalization

VALIDATION:
• Temporal train/test split (80/20)
• Train on earlier seasons, test on most recent
• Prevents data leakage
• Cross-validation respects time ordering

EVALUATION:
• Accuracy (primary metric)
• Log loss (probability quality)
• Calibration curves (do probabilities match reality?)
• Feature importance analysis (coefficient interpretation)
• Confusion matrix (per-class performance)

================================================================================
EXPECTED RESULTS
================================================================================

PERFORMANCE:
• Test Accuracy: 65-75%
• Improvement over baseline: 20-40%
• Log Loss: 0.8-1.0

KEY FINDINGS:
• Recent form and goal difference are strongest predictors
• Draws are hardest to predict (consistent with literature)
• Recency weighting improves accuracy by 3-5 percentage points
• Model produces well-calibrated probability estimates
• Relative team strength matters more than absolute strength

FEATURES THAT MATTER MOST:
1. Goal difference advantage (home vs away recent form)
2. Points advantage (recent performance)
3. Attack vs defense matchups
4. Recent wins/losses
5. Head-to-head history
