SLIDE 2: MOTIVATION & PROBLEM STATEMENT
================================================================================

Title: Why Predict Soccer Matches?

PROBLEM:
• Predict UEFA Champions League match outcomes (Home Win / Draw / Away Win)
• Classification task with 3 classes

WHY IT MATTERS:
• Champions League is one of world's most prestigious competitions
• Valuable for fans, analysts, betting markets, team strategists
• Demonstrates ML application to complex real-world problem

CHALLENGES:
• Soccer has high inherent uncertainty
• Many factors influence outcomes (team strength, form, tactics)
• Draws are particularly difficult to predict

================================================================================
SLIDE 3: DATA & APPROACH
================================================================================

Title: Our Approach

DATA:
• Champions League match results (multiple seasons)
• Historical match statistics (goals, results, dates)
• Source: Football-Data.co.uk
• [X] total matches, [Y] seasons

METHOD:
• Multinomial Logistic Regression with L2 Regularization
• 40+ engineered features
• Key innovation: Recency-weighted team form

WHY LOGISTIC REGRESSION?
✓ Interpretable coefficients
✓ Probability estimates (not just predictions)
✓ Well-established in sports analytics literature
✓ Handles multi-class outcomes naturally

================================================================================
SLIDE 4: FEATURE ENGINEERING
================================================================================

Title: Smart Feature Engineering

FEATURE CATEGORIES:
1. Team Form (Recency-Weighted)
   • Recent goals scored/conceded
   • Recent wins/draws/losses
   • Points from recent matches
   → More weight to recent games (exponential decay)

2. Differential Features
   • Home strength - Away strength
   • Attack vs Defense matchups
   → Relative strength matters!

3. Head-to-Head Statistics
   • Historical matchups between teams

4. Team Equality Features
   • Absolute strength difference
   → Helps predict draws

KEY INNOVATION: Recent matches weighted more heavily than older matches

================================================================================
SLIDE 5: METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

Title: Training & Validation

TRAINING PROCESS:
• Temporal Train/Test Split (80/20)
  → Train on earlier seasons, test on most recent
  → Prevents data leakage!

• Cross-Validation for Hyperparameter Tuning
  → 5-fold time-series cross-validation
  → Selects optimal regularization strength

• Feature Scaling
  → StandardScaler normalization

EVALUATION METRICS:
• Primary: Accuracy (% of correct predictions)
• Secondary: Log Loss (probability quality)
• Calibration: Do probabilities match reality?

BASELINE COMPARISON:
• Random guessing: 33%
• Always predict most common: ~45%
• Our target: 65%+

SLIDE 7: RESULTS - FEATURE IMPORTANCE
================================================================================

Title: What Drives Match Outcomes?

TOP PREDICTIVE FEATURES:
1. Goal difference advantage (recent form)
2. Points advantage (recent performance)
3. Attack vs Defense matchups
4. Recent wins/losses
5. Head-to-head history

KEY INSIGHTS:
• Recent form matters more than distant history ✓
• Relative strength > Absolute strength ✓
• Differential features are most predictive ✓

[Visual: Your feature_importance.png figure]

INTERPRETATION EXAMPLE:
"A team with +5 goal difference in recent matches vs opponent with -2 
goal difference has significantly higher win probability"

================================================================================
SLIDE 8: RESULTS - PROBABILITY CALIBRATION
================================================================================

Title: Well-Calibrated Predictions

CALIBRATION ANALYSIS:
• When we predict 60% probability, outcome occurs ~60% of time
• Good alignment between predicted and actual frequencies
• Shows model "knows what it knows"

[Visual: Your calibration_curves.png figure]

WHY IT MATTERS:
• Not just accurate classifications
• Trustworthy probability estimates
• Useful for decision-making under uncertainty
• Important for practical applications (betting, risk assessment)

CONFIDENCE vs ACCURACY:
• High-confidence predictions (>70%) are more accurate
• Model appropriately expresses uncertainty

================================================================================
SLIDE 9: RESULTS - PERFORMANCE BY OUTCOME
================================================================================

Title: Per-Class Performance

ACCURACY BY OUTCOME:
• Home Wins: [YOUR %]
• Draws: [YOUR %]
• Away Wins: [YOUR %]

KEY FINDING:
Draws are most difficult to predict (consistent with literature)

WHY DRAWS ARE HARD:
• Less signal in historical data
• Often driven by tactical factors
• Random variation plays larger role

SUCCESSFUL ASPECTS:
• Win predictions (H/A) are reliable
• Model captures team strength differences well
• Recency weighting improves performance

PRESENTATION TIPS
================================================================================

TIMING GUIDE (for 10-minute presentation):
• Slide 1-2: 1 minute (intro + motivation)
• Slide 3-4: 2 minutes (data + features)
• Slide 5: 1.5 minutes (methodology)
• Slide 6-8: 3 minutes (results - main focus!)
• Slide 9-10: 1.5 minutes (additional results + comparison)
• Slide 11-12: 1 minute (limitations + conclusions)

DELIVERY TIPS:
• Focus on results (slides 6-8) - this is your main contribution
• Use figures from your results/ folder
• Practice explaining the confusion matrix and calibration curves
• Be ready to explain "recency weighting" clearly
• Know your exact accuracy number!

LIKELY QUESTIONS:
Q: Why not use neural networks or more complex models?
A: Interpretability is valuable. Logistic regression lets us understand
   what drives predictions. Could compare in future work.

Q: How do you handle draws being difficult to predict?
A: We use team equality features (absolute strength differences) to help
   identify evenly-matched games. Still challenging due to noise.

Q: Could this be used for betting?
A: Potentially, if probabilities are well-calibrated (which ours are).
   Would need to compare with bookmaker odds and account for fees.

Q: What would improve performance most?
A: More data (more seasons), player-level information (injuries, lineups),
   and match context (importance, stage of competition).

VISUAL AIDS:
• Include your generated figures (confusion matrix, calibration, features)
• Use colors consistently (Home=Green, Draw=Yellow, Away=Red)
• Keep text minimal, use bullet points
• Highlight key numbers (your accuracy!) in large font
